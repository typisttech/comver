/*
Package comver provides the ability to work with [composer supported versions] in Go.

Due to implementation complexity, this package only supports a subset of composer versioning.
Refer to the [version_test.go] for examples.

For better compatibility, use [composer-semver] instead.

[composer supported versions]: https://github.com/composer/semver/
[version_test.go]: https://github.com/typisttech/comver/blob/main/version_test.go
[composer-semver]: https://github.com/typisttech/composer-semver/
